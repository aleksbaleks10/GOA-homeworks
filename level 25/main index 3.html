        <h1>information about first computer</h1>
        <p>The world's first mechanical computer was created in 1822.
            Its creator was the English mathematician Charles Babbage, who today is called the father of the computer.After his death, his youngest son, Henry Babbage, made his computer a reality in 1910. The creation of the father-son duo has very little in common with today's computers.
            Visually, it has such a different shape and design that you wouldn't even realize that it was a computer.

            Visually, the first programmable computer, the Z1, also had little in common with today's computers, and it has a very interesting history of creation.

            It was built in 1936-1938 by the German scientist Kornad Zuse in his parents' living room, and until 1939, Kornad's parents were the sponsors of his scientific activities.</p>
